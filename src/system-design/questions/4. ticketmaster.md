# Design Ticketmaster

## Functional Requirements

1. Users should be able to view events
2. Users should be able to search for events
3. Users should be able to book tickets to events

## Non Functional Requirements

1. The system should prioritize availability for searching & viewing events, but should prioritize consistency for
   booking events (no double booking)
2. The system should be scalable and able to handle high throughput in the form of popular events (10 million users, one
   event)
3. The system should have low latency search (< 500ms)
4. The system is read heavy, and thus needs to be able to support high read throughput (100:1)

## Core Entities

1. Events
2. Users
3. Venues
4. Performers
5. Tickets
6. Bookings

## APIs

```
GET /events/:eventId -> Event & Venue & Performer & Ticket[]

- tickets are to render the seat map on the Client
```

```
GET /events/search?keyword={keyword}&start={start_date}&end={end_date}&pageSize={page_size}&page={page_number} -> Event[]
```

When it comes to purchasing/booking a ticket, we have a post endpoint that takes the list of tickets and payment payment
details and returns a bookingId.

Later in the design, we'll evolve this into two separate endpoints - one for reserving a ticket and one for confirming a
purchase, but this is a good starting point.

```
POST /bookings/:eventId -> bookingId
 {
   "ticketIds": string[], 
   "paymentDetails": ...
 }
```
