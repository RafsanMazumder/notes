# Design Leetcode

## Functional Requirements

1. Users should be able to view a list of coding problems.
2. Users should be able to view a given problem, code a solution in multiple languages.
3. Users should be able to submit their solution and get instant feedback.
4. Users should be able to view a live leaderboard for competitions.

## Non Functional Requirements

1. The system should prioritize availability over consistency.
2. The system should support isolation and security when running user code.
3. The system should return submission results within 5 seconds.
4. The system should scale to support competitions with 100,000 users.

## Core Entities

1. Problem
2. Submission
3. Leaderboard
4. User

## APIs

```
// Get a list of problems
GET /problems?page=1&limit=100 -> Partial<Problem>[]
```

```
// Get a specific problem
GET /problems/:id?language={language} -> Problem
```

```
// Submit a solution
POST /problems/:id/submit -> Submission
{
  code: string,
  language: string
}

- userId not passed into the API, we can assume the user is authenticated and the userId is stored in the session
```

```
// View Live Leadeboard for competitions
GET /leaderboard/:competitionId?page=1&limit=100 -> Leaderboard
```

## High Level Design

**Users should be able to view a list of coding problems**
