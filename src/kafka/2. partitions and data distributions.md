# ✅ Kafka Interview Notes: 2. Partitions and Data Distribution

---

## 🔷 Why Partitioning Matters

Partitioning is **core to Kafka's scalability, parallelism, and performance**. Each topic in Kafka is split into one or
more **partitions**, and these partitions are distributed across brokers.

This helps Kafka handle:

* **Massive throughput** (due to parallelism)
* **Data distribution** (load balancing)
* **Ordering guarantees** (within partitions)

**Interview insight**: *Partitioning is what makes Kafka fundamentally different from traditional message queues. While
RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ struggle with horizontal scaling, Kafka's partition-based architecture allows it to scale linearly
by adding more brokers.*

## 🔸 Key Concepts

### 🔹 1. What is a Partition?

* A **partition** is a **sequential, append-only log**.
* Kafka guarantees **message order within a partition**, not across partitions.
* Each message is assigned a **sequential offset** in the partition.

> Think of a partition as a file that keeps growing as more messages are appended.

**Deep dive for interviews:**

- *"Why are partitions append-only?"* - This design enables Kafka's incredible write performance. Sequential writes to
  disk are much faster than random writes. Additionally, append-only logs are naturally immutable, which simplifies
  replication and recovery.

- *"What's the relationship between partition size and performance?"* - Larger partitions mean more data per partition
  but can slow down recovery time if a broker fails. Smaller partitions allow faster failover but create more overhead.
  The sweet spot is usually 1-10GB per partition.

**Real-world scenario**: In a payment processing system, you might partition by `user_id` to ensure all transactions for
a user are processed in order, enabling accurate balance calculations.

---

### 🔹 2. Partitioning Strategy

#### ➤ Kafka decides **which partition** a message goes to, based on:

1. **If a key is provided**:
    * Kafka applies a **hash function** to the key → deterministic partition assignment.
    * Benefit: All messages with the same key go to the **same partition** → ensures ordering.

2. **If no key is provided**:
    * Kafka uses **round-robin** across all available partitions → good for load balancing but no ordering guarantee.

#### ➤ Example:

```java
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "customer-123", "order-001"));
```

All messages with key `customer-123` will always go to the same partition.

**Advanced partitioning concepts interviewers love:**

**Custom Partitioners:**

- *"When would you write a custom partitioner?"* - When default hash partitioning doesn't meet your needs. Examples:
    - Geographic partitioning (US users → partition 0, EU users → partition 1)
    - Priority-based partitioning (VIP customers → dedicated partitions)
    - Time-based partitioning (morning data → partition 0, evening → partition 1)

**Partition Skew Problem:**

- *"What causes hot partitions?"* - Poor key distribution. If 80% of your users have the same key prefix, those messages
  will hash to the same partition, creating a bottleneck.
- *"How do you detect hot partitions?"* - Monitor partition-level metrics like message rate, byte rate, and consumer lag
  per partition.
- *"How do you fix hot partitions?"* - Redesign your partitioning key, use a compound key, or implement custom
  partitioning logic.

**Real-world partitioning strategies:**

- **E-commerce**: Partition by `customer_id` for order processing, but by `product_id` for inventory updates
- **IoT**: Partition by `device_id` for device-specific processing, but by `sensor_type` for analytics
- **Financial**: Partition by `account_id` for transaction processing, but by `transaction_type` for fraud detection

### 🔹 3. Partition Assignment (Producer Side)

* Kafka producers **don't choose brokers**, they choose a partition.
* The **Kafka cluster manages which broker is the leader** for that partition.
* Producers only need to know the **topic + bootstrap servers**; Kafka will route correctly.

**Producer partition selection deep dive:**

**Sticky Partitioning (Kafka 2.4+):**

- For messages without keys, instead of strict round-robin, Kafka uses "sticky partitioning"
- Batches multiple keyless messages to the same partition before switching
- Improves throughput by creating larger, more efficient batches
- *"Why is sticky partitioning better than round-robin?"* - Reduces the number of requests and improves batching
  efficiency, leading to higher throughput.

**Partition Discovery:**

- Producers maintain metadata about which broker leads each partition
- Metadata is refreshed periodically or when errors occur
- *"What happens if a producer sends to a partition whose leader has changed?"* - The producer gets a metadata refresh
  error, updates its view of the cluster, and retries to the new leader.

---

### 🔹 4. Partition Assignment (Consumer Side)

* Consumers are part of a **consumer group**.
* Kafka uses a **partition assignment strategy** to distribute partitions:
    * **RangeAssignor**: Assigns contiguous partitions
    * **RoundRobinAssignor**: Distributes partitions evenly
    * **CooperativeStickyAssignor** (Kafka 2.4+): Minimizes reassignments during rebalancing

#### ➤ Rule:

Each partition is consumed by **only one consumer within a group**, but the same partition can be consumed by **multiple
groups independently**.

**Assignment Strategy Deep Dive:**

**RangeAssignor Example:**

- Topic with 6 partitions, 3 consumers
- Consumer 1: partitions 0, 1
- Consumer 2: partitions 2, 3
- Consumer 3: partitions 4, 5
- *Problem*: If you have multiple topics, some consumers get more partitions than others

**RoundRobinAssignor Example:**

- Better distribution across topics
- Consumer 1: partitions 0, 3
- Consumer 2: partitions 1, 4
- Consumer 3: partitions 2, 5

**CooperativeStickyAssignor (Most Important for Interviews):**

- Minimizes partition movement during rebalancing
- Consumers keep their existing partitions when possible
- *"Why is this important?"* - Reduces the impact of rebalancing. Instead of stopping all consumers, only affected
  partitions are reassigned.

**Interview scenarios:**

- *"What happens if you have more consumers than partitions?"* - Extra consumers remain idle. This is why partition
  count affects your maximum parallelism.
- *"What happens if you have more partitions than consumers?"* - Some consumers handle multiple partitions. This is fine
  and normal.
- *"How do you handle uneven partition assignment?"* - Use appropriate assignment strategies, or manually assign
  partitions if you need fine-grained control.

### 🔹 5. Partition Count Trade-Offs

| #Partitions | Pros                                       | Cons                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| More        | - More parallelism<br>- Higher throughput  | - More open files<br>- More memory & CPU overhead     |
| Fewer       | - Simpler coordination<br>- Lower overhead | - Limited parallelism<br>- Bottlenecks in consumption |

**Kafka recommends starting with 1–2 partitions per CPU core**, depending on throughput.

**Detailed trade-off analysis for interviews:**

**Memory Impact:**

- Each partition consumes memory for buffering, indexing, and replication
- Rule of thumb: ~1MB of heap per partition per broker
- *"How many partitions can a broker handle?"* - Typically 2000-4000 partitions per broker, depending on hardware

**File Handle Impact:**

- Each partition uses several file handles (log files, index files)
- Linux default is 1024 file handles per process
- Production systems need to tune `ulimit` and OS-level settings

**Replication Impact:**

- More partitions = more replication traffic
- Leader election time increases with partition count
- *"How does partition count affect recovery time?"* - More partitions mean longer controller election and replica
  recovery

**End-to-end Latency:**

- More partitions can increase latency due to batching behavior
- Fewer partitions might create throughput bottlenecks
- Sweet spot depends on your use case

**Sizing guidelines interviewers ask about:**

- Start with: `(target throughput) / (throughput per partition)`
- Factor in future growth (3-5x current load)
- Consider consumer parallelism needs
- Plan for peak traffic scenarios

### 🔹 6. Rebalancing and Partition Movement

* Kafka dynamically **rebalance partitions** when:
    * A consumer joins or leaves a group
    * Partitions are added
* Consumers can experience a **brief pause during rebalancing**.
* With **cooperative rebalancing**, Kafka reduces the overhead of stopping and restarting all consumers.

**Rebalancing Deep Dive (Critical Interview Topic):**

**Stop-the-World vs Cooperative Rebalancing:**

- **Traditional rebalancing**: All consumers stop, reassignment happens, all consumers restart
- **Cooperative rebalancing**: Only affected consumers stop, others continue processing
- *"Why is cooperative rebalancing important?"* - Reduces processing gaps and improves availability during scaling
  events

**Rebalancing Triggers:**

- Consumer joins group (scaling up)
- Consumer leaves group (scaling down or failure)
- Consumer heartbeat timeout (network issues)
- Partition count changes
- Consumer subscription changes

**Minimizing Rebalancing Impact:**

- Use CooperativeStickyAssignor
- Tune `session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms`
- Ensure consumers process quickly to avoid timeouts
- Use static group membership for stable consumers

**Real-world rebalancing scenarios:**

- *"A consumer crashes during Black Friday traffic. What happens?"* - Kafka detects the failure via missed heartbeats,
  triggers rebalancing, and redistributes the crashed consumer's partitions to remaining consumers. There's a brief
  processing pause.
- *"You need to deploy a new version of your consumer application. How do you minimize disruption?"* - Use rolling
  deployments with cooperative rebalancing, or implement graceful shutdown handling.

### 🔹 7. Partition Affinity

Partitioning helps with **affinity-based processing**:

* Example: All events for a `user_id` go to the same partition.
* Enables **stateful processing**, e.g., counting user actions.

**Advanced Affinity Concepts:**

**State Management:**

- Partition affinity allows consumers to maintain local state
- Example: Running totals, session data, or caches per user
- When partition ownership changes, state must be transferred or rebuilt

**Stream Processing Applications:**

- Kafka Streams leverages partition affinity for stateful operations
- State stores are partitioned the same way as input topics
- *"How does Kafka Streams handle partition affinity?"* - It co-partitions related data and maintains state stores that
  match the partitioning scheme

**Hot Partition Avoidance:**

- Good affinity design prevents hot partitions
- Example: Instead of partitioning by `company_id` (might be skewed), use `user_id`
- Or use compound keys: `company_id + random_suffix`

---

### 🔹 8. Changing Partition Count

You can **increase** the number of partitions after topic creation:

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic my-topic --partitions 10
```

⚠️ **Caution**: This affects key-based partitioning. Messages with the same key may now hash to a different partition,
breaking ordering.

> Best practice: Choose the correct number of partitions **up front**.

**Partition Count Changes - Interview Deep Dive:**

**Why You Can't Decrease Partitions:**

- Kafka would need to merge partition logs, which is complex and expensive
- Would break ordering guarantees and consumer offset management
- Existing data would need to be reorganized

**Impact of Increasing Partitions:**

- *"What breaks when you add partitions?"* - Key-based routing changes for new messages
- Existing messages stay in their original partitions
- New messages with the same key might go to different partitions
- Consumer group rebalancing occurs

**Strategies for Partition Expansion:**

- Plan for growth upfront - slightly over-partition initially
- If you must expand, ensure your application can handle ordering changes
- Consider creating a new topic with correct partitioning and migrating data
- Use timestamp-based or epoch-based strategies to handle the transition

**Real-world scenarios:**

- *"Your topic has grown beyond capacity. How do you scale it?"* - Options include adding partitions (with caveats),
  creating new topics, or implementing application-level sharding.

## 🔸 Advanced Partitioning Patterns

### Multi-Tenancy Partitioning

- Partition by tenant ID for isolation
- Dedicated partitions for high-value customers
- Cross-tenant analytics using separate consumer groups

### Time-Based Partitioning

- Partition by time windows (hour, day)
- Enables efficient data deletion and archival
- Useful for time-series data and analytics

### Geographic Partitioning

- Partition by region or data center
- Reduces cross-region data transfer
- Enables region-specific processing

## 🔸 Diagrams

**Message Distribution by Key**

```
Producer --> Key = "user42" --> Hash --> Partition 3 --> Broker B
Producer --> Key = "user99" --> Hash --> Partition 1 --> Broker A
```

**Consumer Group Assignment**

```
Topic: payments (4 partitions)
Consumer Group: fraud-detectors (2 consumers)

Partition 0 → Consumer 1
Partition 1 → Consumer 1
Partition 2 → Consumer 2
Partition 3 → Consumer 2
```

**Hot Partition Problem**

```
Poor partitioning (by company):
Company A (90% of traffic) → Partition 1 (overloaded)
Company B (5% of traffic) → Partition 2 (underutilized)
Company C (5% of traffic) → Partition 3 (underutilized)

Better partitioning (by user_id):
Users distributed evenly across all partitions
```
