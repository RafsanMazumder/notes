# ✅ Kafka Interview Notes: 4. Consumers & Consumer Groups

---

## 🔷 Overview

A **Kafka consumer** is a client application that reads records from topics. Kafka's consumer model is **pull-based** (
i.e., consumers poll for new data) and built to support **horizontal scaling** through **consumer groups** and *
*partition assignment**.

**Interview insight**: *The pull-based model is fundamental to Kafka's scalability. Unlike push-based systems where
brokers decide when to send data, consumers control their consumption rate, enabling better backpressure handling and
allowing consumers to process at their own pace.*

---

## 🔸 1. Kafka Consumer Basics

* Consumers read records from one or more **partitions** of a topic.
* Records are read **sequentially** from an **offset** (a per-partition record ID).
* Kafka **does not push data** – consumers must **poll** regularly to receive data.

### Pull vs Push Model Deep Dive:

**Why Pull-based?**

- *"What are the advantages of pull over push?"* - Consumers control their consumption rate, can handle backpressure
  naturally, and can batch requests efficiently
- **Backpressure handling**: If consumer is slow, it simply polls less frequently rather than overwhelming its buffers
- **Batch efficiency**: Consumers can request many messages in one poll, reducing network overhead
- **Consumer autonomy**: Each consumer can have different processing speeds without affecting others

**Consumer Poll Loop Pattern:**

```java
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        process(record);
    }
    consumer.commitSync(); // Manual commit after processing
}
```

**Advanced Pull Concepts:**

- *"What happens if poll() is not called frequently enough?"* - Consumer may be removed from group due to
  `max.poll.interval.ms` timeout
- *"How does Kafka handle slow consumers?"* - Consumer lag increases, but other consumers in group continue processing
  their partitions
- **Poll timeout tuning**: Short timeouts for responsive applications, longer timeouts for batch processing

---

## 🔸 2. Consumer Groups

A **consumer group** is a **set of consumers that work together** to consume data from a topic.

* Kafka assigns **each partition to only one consumer** within a group.
* Multiple consumers can exist across different groups and **read the same data** independently.
* Consumers in the same group **share the work** of reading from the topic.

#### Example:

```
Topic: orders (6 partitions)
Consumer Group A:
  - Consumer 1 → partitions 0, 1, 2
  - Consumer 2 → partitions 3, 4, 5

Consumer Group B:
  - Consumer X → partitions 0–5 (reads all)
```

> This allows Kafka to implement **horizontal scalability** for consumers.

### Consumer Group Deep Dive (Critical Interview Topic):

**Consumer Group Coordinator:**

- Each consumer group has a designated broker as its coordinator
- Coordinator manages group membership and partition assignments
- *"How is coordinator chosen?"* - Based on hash of group ID, ensures even distribution across brokers

**Group Membership Protocol:**

- Consumers send heartbeats to coordinator to maintain membership
- `session.timeout.ms`: Max time without heartbeat before considered dead
- `heartbeat.interval.ms`: Frequency of heartbeat messages (usually 1/3 of session timeout)

**Assignment Strategies Deep Dive:**

**RangeAssignor (Default):**

```
Topic with 7 partitions, 3 consumers:
Consumer 1: partitions 0, 1, 2
Consumer 2: partitions 3, 4
Consumer 3: partitions 5, 6
```

- *Problem*: Uneven distribution, especially with multiple topics

**RoundRobinAssignor:**

```
Consumer 1: partitions 0, 3, 6
Consumer 2: partitions 1, 4
Consumer 3: partitions 2, 5
```

- Better distribution but can cause issues if consumers have different processing capabilities

**StickyAssignor:**

- Maintains existing assignments when possible
- Minimizes partition movement during rebalancing
- *"Why is stickiness important?"* - Preserves consumer state, reduces rebalancing overhead

**Static Group Membership (Kafka 2.3+):**

```java
props.put("group.instance.id", "consumer-1"); // Static ID
```

- Consumer keeps same identity across restarts
- Avoids rebalancing for planned restarts
- *"When would you use static membership?"* - Stream processing applications where rebalancing is expensive

### Multi-Consumer Group Patterns:

**Fan-out Pattern:**

- Same data consumed by multiple groups for different purposes
- Example: Orders topic → [Real-time dashboard, Batch analytics, Audit logging]

**Hierarchical Processing:**

- Multiple stages of processing with different consumer groups
- Example: Raw events → Enrichment → Aggregation → Storage

**Disaster Recovery:**

- Separate consumer groups in different data centers
- Primary processes normally, secondary takes over during failures

---

## 🔸 3. Partition Rebalancing

Partition rebalancing happens when:

* A new consumer **joins** or **leaves** the group
* A consumer **crashes**
* The **number of partitions changes**

Rebalancing involves:

1. **Pausing all consumers** in the group
2. **Reassigning partitions** to consumers
3. **Resuming consumption**

#### Side Effects:

* Rebalancing is a **disruptive** operation
* **Offsets** must be preserved to avoid duplication or loss

### Rebalancing Deep Dive (High-Frequency Interview Topic):

**Rebalancing Triggers in Detail:**

**Consumer Join:**

- New consumer sends JoinGroup request to coordinator
- Coordinator waits for `rebalance.timeout.ms` for all consumers to join
- *"What happens if a consumer is slow to join?"* - It gets excluded from the group until next rebalance

**Consumer Leave/Crash:**

- Graceful leave: Consumer sends LeaveGroup request
- Crash detection: Coordinator notices missing heartbeats after `session.timeout.ms`
- *"How do you distinguish between slow consumer and crashed consumer?"* - Session timeout vs max poll interval timeout

**Consumer Processing Timeout:**

- `max.poll.interval.ms`: Max time between poll() calls
- If exceeded, consumer is considered failed even if sending heartbeats
- *"Why separate heartbeat and poll timeouts?"* - Heartbeat shows consumer is alive, poll timeout shows it's actually
  processing

**Rebalancing Protocol Steps:**

1. **Stop the world**: All consumers stop processing
2. **Join Group**: Consumers request group membership
3. **Leader Election**: Coordinator selects group leader (usually first consumer)
4. **Assignment**: Leader calculates partition assignment
5. **Sync Group**: Assignment distributed to all consumers
6. **Resume**: Consumers start processing assigned partitions

**Rebalancing Performance Impact:**

- Processing stops during rebalancing (typically 1-30 seconds)
- Consumer lag increases during rebalancing pause
- Frequency directly impacts application availability

### 🔹 Cooperative Rebalancing (Kafka 2.4+)

Kafka introduced **cooperative sticky assignor** to improve rebalancing.

* Allows **incremental rebalancing**:
    * Only partitions that need to move are reassigned
    * No full stop of all consumers

```java
props.put("partition.assignment.strategy", "CooperativeStickyAssignor");
```

✅ Faster rebalancing
✅ Reduced consumer downtime
✅ Better for long-running apps or stream processing

**Cooperative Rebalancing Implementation:**

- Consumers continue processing partitions they keep
- Only consumers losing/gaining partitions pause briefly
- Typical rebalancing time: 100-500ms vs 5-30 seconds

**Migration to Cooperative Rebalancing:**

- Can't mix eager and cooperative strategies in same group
- Requires coordinated deployment or rolling upgrade strategy
- *"How do you migrate from eager to cooperative rebalancing?"* - Use dual strategy during transition period

**Real-world rebalancing scenarios:**

- *"Black Friday traffic spike requires scaling from 3 to 12 consumers. What happens?"* - Multiple rebalancing rounds as
  consumers join, brief processing pauses, eventual even distribution
- *"Kubernetes pod restart during business hours. How do you minimize impact?"* - Use cooperative rebalancing + static
  group membership + graceful shutdown

---

## 🔸 4. Offset Management

An **offset** is a pointer to the consumer's current position in a partition.

* Kafka **does not automatically delete records after reading** – the consumer must **track its offset**.
* Offsets are stored:
    * In a **special Kafka topic** (`__consumer_offsets`)
    * Or **externally** (e.g., DB, Redis, Zookeeper)

### Offset Storage Deep Dive:

**Internal Offset Storage (`__consumer_offsets`):**

- Compacted topic storing latest offset for each consumer group + partition
- Replication factor typically same as cluster (usually 3)
- *"Why use a Kafka topic to store offsets?"* - Leverages Kafka's durability and replication guarantees
- Automatic cleanup of old consumer group metadata

**External Offset Storage:**

- Store offsets in application database alongside processed results
- Enables atomic commit of processing + offset update
- *"When would you use external offset storage?"* - When you need exactly-once processing with external systems (
  database writes + offset commits)

**Offset Commit Strategies:**

### 🔹 Auto vs Manual Commit

#### 🟢 Auto Commit (default)

* Offsets are committed **periodically** (default: every 5 seconds)

```java
enable.auto.commit=true
auto.commit.interval.ms=5000
```

* Simpler but risky:
    * May **lose messages** (if commit before processing)
    * May **reprocess messages** (if crash before commit)

**Auto Commit Scenarios:**

- *"Consumer polls 100 messages, processes 50, auto-commit happens, then crashes. What occurs?"* - 50 messages are lost
  because offsets were committed before processing
- *"When is auto commit acceptable?"* - Fire-and-forget scenarios, analytics where some data loss is acceptable,
  idempotent processing

#### 🔴 Manual Commit

* You control **when offsets are committed**, ensuring **processing is complete**

```java
enable.auto.commit=false
consumer.commitSync(); // or commitAsync()
```

> Best practice: Use **manual commit** for applications that care about **processing guarantees**.

**Manual Commit Patterns:**

**Per-Batch Commit:**

```java
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        process(record);
    }
    consumer.commitSync(); // Commit after processing all records in batch
}
```

**Per-Message Commit (Expensive):**

```java
for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
    process(record);
    consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(
        new TopicPartition(record.topic(), record.partition()),
        new OffsetAndMetadata(record.offset() + 1)
    ));
}
```

**Atomic Processing + Commit:**

```java
// Begin database transaction
dbTransaction.begin();
try {
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        processToDatabase(record, dbTransaction);
    }
    dbTransaction.commit();
    consumer.commitSync(); // Only commit offset after DB commit
} catch (Exception e) {
    dbTransaction.rollback();
    // Don't commit offset - will reprocess
}
```

### 🔹 Commit Types

| Method          | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `commitSync()`  | Blocks until broker confirms         |
| `commitAsync()` | Non-blocking, may skip failures      |
| Combined        | Try async, fallback to sync on close |

**Commit Strategy Deep Dive:**

**Synchronous Commit:**

- Blocks until offset is persisted
- Retries automatically on failure
- Guarantees offset is committed before proceeding
- *"Performance impact"*: Adds latency to processing loop

**Asynchronous Commit:**

- Returns immediately, commits in background
- No automatic retries (could commit out-of-order offsets)
- Higher throughput but less durability guarantee
- *"When do you use async commit?"* - High-throughput scenarios where occasional reprocessing is acceptable

**Hybrid Approach (Production Pattern):**

```java
try {
    while (true) {
        ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
        process(records);
        consumer.commitAsync(); // Fast async commit during normal operation
    }
} finally {
    consumer.commitSync(); // Ensure final offset is committed on shutdown
}
```

**Offset Commit Failures:**

- `CommitFailedException`: Another consumer in group committed offsets (rebalancing occurred)
- `RebalanceInProgressException`: Rebalancing happening, retry after completion
- Network errors: Automatic retry for sync, manual handling for async

---

## 🔸 Offset Reset Policy

Controls what to do if no previous offset is found:

```java
auto.offset.reset=earliest | latest | none
```

| Value      | Behavior                           |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| `earliest` | Start from beginning of partition  |
| `latest`   | Start from end (new messages only) |
| `none`     | Throw error if no offset is found  |

### Offset Reset Scenarios (Common Interview Topic):

**When Offset Reset is Triggered:**

- New consumer group (no previous offsets)
- Offset committed is beyond current partition end
- Offset committed is before current retention start (data deleted)

**Reset Policy Decision Matrix:**

- **earliest**: Batch processing, data migration, ensuring no data loss
- **latest**: Real-time applications, notifications, live metrics
- **none**: Explicit error handling, ensure conscious decision about data

**Advanced Offset Management:**

**Seeking to Specific Offsets:**

```java
// Seek to beginning
consumer.seekToBeginning(Arrays.asList(partition));

// Seek to specific offset
consumer.seek(partition, specificOffset);

// Seek by timestamp
Map<TopicPartition, Long> timestampsToSearch = Map.of(partition, timestamp);
Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndTimestamp> offsets = consumer.offsetsForTimes(timestampsToSearch);
```

**Consumer Reset Tools:**

```bash
# Reset consumer group to earliest
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group my-group --reset-offsets --to-earliest --topic my-topic --execute

# Reset to specific timestamp
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group my-group --reset-offsets --to-datetime 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000 \
  --topic my-topic --execute
```

## 🔸 Advanced Consumer Patterns

### Message Filtering and Processing Patterns

**Client-Side Filtering:**

```java
for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
    if (shouldProcess(record)) {
        process(record);
    }
    // Still commit offset even for filtered messages
}
```

**Batch Processing Pattern:**

```java
List<ConsumerRecord<String, String>> batch = new ArrayList<>();
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    batch.addAll(records);
    
    if (batch.size() >= BATCH_SIZE || shouldFlushBatch()) {
        processBatch(batch);
        consumer.commitSync();
        batch.clear();
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

**Dead Letter Topic Pattern:**

```java
for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
    try {
        process(record);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        sendToDeadLetterTopic(record, e);
    }
}
```

**Retry with Backoff:**

```java
for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
    int retries = 0;
    while (retries < MAX_RETRIES) {
        try {
            process(record);
            break;
        } catch (RetriableException e) {
            retries++;
            Thread.sleep(BACKOFF_MS * retries);
        }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Threading Patterns

**Single Consumer, Multiple Worker Threads:**

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(WORKER_THREADS);
while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
        executor.submit(() -> process(record));
    }
    // Note: Offset management becomes complex with async processing
}
```

**Multiple Consumers (Preferred):**

- Each consumer runs in separate thread
- Simpler offset management
- Better fault isolation

## 🔸 Consumer Lifecycle Summary

1. Consumer joins a group
2. Kafka assigns partitions to consumers
3. Consumer polls data, processes records
4. Commits offset (auto or manual)
5. If rebalancing occurs → partitions may be reassigned

### Detailed Consumer Lifecycle:

**Startup Sequence:**

1. **Configuration**: Set bootstrap servers, group ID, deserializers
2. **Subscription**: Subscribe to topics or assign specific partitions
3. **Group Join**: Send JoinGroup request to coordinator
4. **Partition Assignment**: Receive partition assignment from coordinator
5. **Initial Positioning**: Seek to last committed offset or apply reset policy

**Normal Operation:**

1. **Poll Loop**: Continuously poll for new records
2. **Processing**: Process received records
3. **Offset Management**: Commit offsets (auto or manual)
4. **Heartbeat**: Send periodic heartbeats to coordinator

**Shutdown Sequence:**

1. **Graceful Stop**: Stop polling and processing
2. **Final Commit**: Commit any pending offsets
3. **Leave Group**: Send LeaveGroup request
4. **Close Resources**: Close consumer and cleanup

**Failure Scenarios:**

- **Processing Timeout**: Consumer removed from group, partitions reassigned
- **Network Failure**: Automatic reconnection and rejoin
- **Coordinator Failure**: Find new coordinator and rejoin
- **Broker Failure**: Automatic metadata refresh and continued operation

## 🔸 Consumer Performance and Tuning

### Key Performance Configurations:

**Fetch Settings:**

- `fetch.min.bytes`: Minimum data per fetch request
- `fetch.max.wait.ms`: Maximum wait time for fetch request
- `max.partition.fetch.bytes`: Maximum data per partition per fetch

**Poll Settings:**

- `max.poll.records`: Maximum records returned per poll
- `max.poll.interval.ms`: Maximum time between polls

**Session Management:**

- `session.timeout.ms`: Consumer failure detection time
- `heartbeat.interval.ms`: Heartbeat frequency

### Performance Tuning Guidelines:

**High Throughput:**

- Increase `fetch.min.bytes` and `max.poll.records`
- Use larger batches for processing
- Consider async commit for faster processing

**Low Latency:**

- Decrease `fetch.max.wait.ms`
- Use smaller `max.poll.records`
- Process records individually rather than batching

**Reliability:**

- Use manual commits with sync
- Set appropriate session timeout vs heartbeat interval
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
