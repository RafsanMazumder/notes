Of course. This is a fantastic and frequently asked topic in database interviews. A deep understanding of the different
lock types demonstrates a strong grasp of how the database engine handles concurrency.

Here are detailed, interview-ready notes on the different types of locks in MySQL, with a focus on the InnoDB storage
engine.

### **Comprehensive Interview Notes: MySQL Lock Types**

### 1. The Two Fundamental Concepts: Granularity and Mode

Before diving into specific types, all locks can be categorized by two primary concepts:

1. **Granularity:** What is the *scope* of the lock? Is it locking an entire table or a single row?
    * **Table-Level Locks:** Coarse-grained. Low overhead, but terrible for concurrency.
    * **Row-Level Locks:** Fine-grained. Higher overhead, but excellent for concurrency. **InnoDB primarily uses
      row-level locking.**

2. **Mode:** What *kind* of access does the lock permit?
    * **Shared (S):** A "read lock." Multiple transactions can hold an S lock on the same resource.
    * **Exclusive (X):** A "write lock." Only one transaction can hold an X lock on a resource.

### 2. High-Level Locks: Table-Level

While InnoDB prefers row-level locks, it still uses table-level locks for certain operations.

#### **Table Locks**

* **What they are:** A lock on an entire table.
* **When they are used:**
    * Explicitly with `LOCK TABLES my_table WRITE;`. This is generally discouraged in InnoDB as it kills concurrency.
    * Implicitly during some DDL operations like `ALTER TABLE`.
    * Internally via **Intention Locks** (see below).

#### **Intention Locks (The "Meta" Locks)**

This is a critical, often misunderstood concept. Intention locks are **table-level locks** that signal the *intent* to
place a row-level lock later. They don't block other intention locks, but they do block full table locks.

* **Purpose:** To solve the problem of lock compatibility efficiently. Imagine `Transaction A` has a row lock on a
  single row in `table_t`. If `Transaction B` wants to place a full table lock (`LOCK TABLES table_t WRITE`), how does
  it know about `Transaction A`'s row lock without checking every single row?
* **Analogy:** Think of a large hotel (the table). Before you lock a single room (a row), you go to the front desk and
  put a small sign on the hotel's master key board that says, "Someone is working in a room on the 3rd floor." This is
  the intention lock. Now, if someone else wants to fumigate the entire hotel (a full table lock), they just need to
  check the front desk's board. They don't have to go check every single room.

* **Types:**
    * **Intention Shared (IS):** Signals the intent to place **Shared (S) row locks**. Placed before a
      `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE`.
    * **Intention Exclusive (IX):** Signals the intent to place **Exclusive (X) row locks**. Placed before an `UPDATE`,
      `DELETE`, or `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.

**Compatibility Matrix (High Level):**

| | Intention Shared (IS) | Intention Exclusive (IX) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intention Shared (IS)** | ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible |
| **Intention Exclusive (IX)**| ✅ Compatible | ✅ Compatible |

*An IS lock at the table level does not conflict with an IX lock. However, a request for a full table S-lock would
conflict with an IX lock.*

### 3. Core InnoDB Locks: Row-Level

This is the most important category for modern MySQL usage. These locks are placed on **index records**, not the data
itself.

#### **Record Lock**

* **What it is:** The simplest row-level lock. It locks a **single index record**.
* **Purpose:** To lock a specific row to prevent it from being updated or deleted by another transaction.
* **How it's used:** This lock is used when you query for a row using a **unique index** (like a Primary Key).
* **Example Trigger:**
  ```sql
  -- This will place a Record Lock on the primary key index entry for id = 101.
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 101 FOR UPDATE;
  ```

#### **Gap Lock**

* **What it is:** A lock on the **gap *between* index records**, or the gap before the first or after the last record.
* **Purpose:** Its sole purpose is to **prevent phantom reads** in the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level. It stops other
  transactions from inserting new data into the locked gap.
* **Key Behavior:**
    * Gap locks **can be shared**. A gap lock taken by one transaction does not block another transaction from taking a
      gap lock on the same gap.
    * They are purely for stopping insertions; they don't stop reads or updates of existing rows.
* **Example Trigger:**
  ```sql
  -- This locks the "gap" between employees with IDs 50 and 60.
  -- Another transaction attempting to INSERT an employee with id = 55 will be blocked.
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id > 50 AND id < 60 FOR UPDATE;
  ```

#### **Next-Key Lock**

* **What it is:** The most common lock in InnoDB. It is a **combination of a Record Lock and a Gap Lock** on the gap
  preceding that record.
* **Purpose:** It locks both a record *and* the space before it. This prevents both modification of the existing record
  and the insertion of a new record in the gap. It's the mechanism that makes `REPEATABLE READ` work so well.
* **How it's used:** This is the **default lock type** used when InnoDB scans an index (e.g., in a `WHERE` clause).
* **Example Trigger:**
  ```sql
  -- Assume employees exist with IDs 90 and 101.
  -- This will place a Next-Key Lock on the index record for id=101.
  -- This locks the record 101 itself, AND it locks the gap (90, 101].
  -- Another transaction cannot INSERT an employee with id = 95 or id = 100.
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 101 FOR UPDATE;
  ```
  *Note: If the index was unique, InnoDB would optimize this to a simple Record Lock. But on a non-unique index, it must
  use a Next-Key Lock to protect the range.*

#### **Insert Intention Lock**

* **What it is:** A special type of **gap lock** that is set by `INSERT` operations before row insertion.
* **Purpose:** To signal the intent to insert into a gap. If multiple transactions are inserting into the *same gap* but
  not at the *same position*, they don't have to wait for each other. This significantly improves concurrency for
  `INSERT` statements.
* **Example Trigger:** Implicitly used by every `INSERT` statement.

| Lock Type | Granularity | What it Locks | Purpose / Solves Problem | Example Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shared (S) Lock** | Row | A specific index record. | A "read-lock" to prevent a row from being changed by others, while still allowing them to read. | `SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE;` |
| **Exclusive (X) Lock** | Row | A specific index record. | A "write-lock" to prevent any other transaction from reading or writing to a row. | `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE;` |
| **Record Lock** | Row | A single index entry. | Basic row locking, typically on unique indexes. | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE WHERE primary_key = X;` |
| **Gap Lock** | Row | The space *between* index records. | Prevents **phantom reads** by blocking `INSERT`s into a range. | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE WHERE col > A AND col < B;` |
| **Next-Key Lock** | Row | A record + the gap before it. | **Default lock.** Prevents both row modification and phantom reads. | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE WHERE non_unique_col = X;` |
| **Intention (IS/IX)** | Table | The table itself (metadata). | A "note on the door" to make table and row locks compatible without scanning. | Implicitly before any `SELECT...FOR` or `UPDATE`. |
| **Insert Intention** | Row | A gap. | An optimized gap lock for high-concurrency `INSERT`s. | Implicitly by `INSERT`. |
