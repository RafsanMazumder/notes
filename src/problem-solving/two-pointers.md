# Two Pointers Problems

**3Sum**

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k,
and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

```cpp

```

**Container With Most Water**

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the
ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
container contains the most water.

```cpp

```

**Trapping Rain Water**

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it
can trap after raining.

```cpp
