# SWE Notes

Welcome to my Software Engineering notebook!  
Here you'll find concise deep-dives into common algorithms, data structures, and C++ essentials—all in Markdown.

## What's Inside

- **Algorithms**: Backtracking · Greedy · Dynamic Programming · Graphs and more  
- **C++**: STL and language idioms
- **Data Structures**: Common implementations and usage patterns

## Why This Notebook?

I created this collection to:
- Serve as a personal reference for technical interviews
- Document elegant solutions to common problems
- Share knowledge with fellow software engineers

Feel free to explore the sections and contribute if you find it useful!
